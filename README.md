# Analog Clock in JavaScript

This is a simple web app that displays an analog clock using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.

## Usage

To use this app, simply download or clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The clock will be displayed on the page.

To view and test any changes you make to the app, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx parcel index.html
```

This will launch a local development server and you can view the app by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:1234/. Any changes you make to the index.html file will be hot-reloaded in the browser automatically, allowing you to quickly see your changes in action.

## Customization

You can customize the clock appearance by editing the `drawClock` function in the `script.js` file. The function uses HTML5 canvas to draw the clock face, hour marks, and hands. You can change the colors, sizes, and styles of these elements to suit your preferences.
